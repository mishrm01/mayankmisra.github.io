(but sincerely thank you).\r\n\r\n**Jekyll-Bootstrap Documentation Website.**\r\n\r\nThe documentation website at <http://jekyllbootstrap.com> is maintained at https://github.com/plusjade/jekyllbootstrap.com\r\n\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\n[MIT](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
